For meticulously managed access to your products within our platform, our role-based access system allows you to edit and customize every action your users will have access to. This system is designed to assign roles specifically created for the activities you require them to perform on your products. Below, we'll show you how to create these roles to assign them to all your users before or after they are invited to your store.

## How do roles work?

Roles on our platform allow you to manage in detail the access you want all your company's users to have to your products. You can learn more about the importance of our roles in the article 'How do roles work?'.

## How to create roles?

Initially, you must access the roles section on our platform. To do this, go to the left menu and, under the 'Administration' section, you will find the option 'Roles', then you will be redirected to the page for creating and editing roles for your store.

On this page, you will find the 'Create user role' button at the top right. By selecting it, you will be taken to the page to create a new role for your store. Here you have the following fields:

- Name: Here you can assign the name you wish for the role, such as 'Supervisor' for those in charge of reviewing your products' data, among others.

The following sections will have drop-down fields to select the corresponding accesses for the role you are creating, grouped by category to facilitate understanding:

- Admin section: Here you will have administrative access to such things as managing the stores of the organization and creating and deleting brands and categories, among other actions.
- Data tables: Customize access to the general product tables on the platform, including access to the table with all your products, as well as the data source product tables.
- Filters/Buttons: This field allows you to customize access to filters and buttons within the stages on our platform.
- Products: Here you can customize access to the product editing card level, such as access to 'Data Sources', 'Variations', 'Attributes', and other product editing sections.
- Raw Products: Customize access to raw products coming from the connection with your distributors, like access to 'Raw Products', 'Raw Brand Mapping', and editing of these. You can learn more in our article 'Raw product data source'.
- Reports: Customize access to the reports on our platform, including access to total, detailed reports and their export to Excel.
- Stages: Customize the access the role will have to each of the stages of our platform.

With these fields, you can manage all the accesses for any role in your store. Remember, there is no limit to selection, allowing you to create specific roles according to your needs for each user.

Moreover, it's important to keep in mind that these roles are unique to each of the stores that make up your organization, which allows you to handle different roles according to the requirements of each store.

## In conclusion

Properly managing your users' access on our platform ensures you total control over what your team can and cannot do with your products.
