Our platform includes an advanced system for user management, based on organizations and access permissions to the stores that comprise it. This system ensures that each person accesses only the appropriate stores, protecting your data and facilitating efficient team management.

## How to invite users, assign stores, and grant permissions

- User invitations: To be part of our platform, each individual can have a unique user account. The owner of an organization can invite these users to join, assigning them access to the necessary stores. This allows each user to manage their own personal profile, whether to create their own organization or join an existing one. If the user does not yet have an account, they can create one using the invitation email and access the organization without any issues. You can learn more about this in our article, **'Invite new users'**.
- Store assignment: When inviting a user, the organization's administrators can specify which stores the user will have access to. If the organization has only one store, access is automatically granted to it. Additionally, it's possible to update the store access permissions at any time.
- Role assignment: In the user management section, administrators can assign specific roles to each user, indicating the role they will have within a particular store. If the organization includes several stores, appropriate roles must be created for each. You can learn more about this in our article, **'How do roles work?'**.
- User removal: Administrators have the ability to remove any user's access within their organization, simply by accessing the delete option in the user management section of any store.

## How to create, modify, and delete user roles

Administrators have the authority to create and adjust roles for each store, adapting them to different access requirements and tasks. The creation or modification of a role defines the access levels to the store that each user will have, such as access to product stages, visibility of administrative data, and editing of product page data.

These actions are performed in the user role management section, where it's possible to create, edit, or delete roles. It's important to remember that these roles are specific to each store; therefore, in organizations with multiple stores, different roles will be observed. Learn more about how to create these roles in our article, **'How to create roles?'**.

## In conclusion

Our platform facilitates intuitive, flexible, and secure user and role management. It offers complete functionalities for inviting users to your stores within your organization, editing their access and permissions, removing them from the organization, and creating specific roles for each team member. This not only improves the efficiency of your team but also ensures the protection of your company's data.
