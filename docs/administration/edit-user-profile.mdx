Our platform, together with our user creation and management system, offers an intuitive interface that allows you to handle and edit all the data related to your account on Infinity. This customization facilitates the efficient and secure management of your account and your organization's data.

Primarily, you can learn about the operation of users on our platform and how to create an account in our article **'How to create an account'**.

To help you better understand everything you can do in relation to editing your user profile on our platform, we have divided the information into segments so you can manage your data in a timely manner. Below, we explain each of these segments:

## Segment 1: Account

In this section, you will find the main data of your account, which includes the personal data with which you created it. This section has the following available fields:

- First name: This field displays the name you provided when creating your account on our platform. You can update this data if needed.
- Last name: Here, you will see the surname used to create your account, which you can update if necessary.
- Email: In this field, you will see the email used to create your account. To edit your email, you can change it and update it in this field. Upon saving, a confirmation page will open that will send a code to your previous email. You will receive an email with this code; by entering it in the page and selecting **'Save'**, you will have successfully updated your email.

## Segment 2: Security

This section allows you to update your account's password. By entering the new password and selecting the **'Change password'** button, and as long as it meets the security standards of our platform, a modal will be displayed informing you that you will receive an email with a validation code to confirm this change. Once the validation code is entered, you will receive confirmation that the password has been updated correctly.

## Segment 3: Organization

If your account is the creator of the organization it belongs to, you will see this section, where you can update the name of your organization within our platform. Remember that only the account that created the organization will be able to make changes to it. No other invited account, regardless of their roles, will be able to update this information.

## Segment 4: Billing & Plans

In this last section, you will find a button called **'Manage subscription'**, which will redirect you to our platform's subscription portal. There, you will have all the details of your subscription with Infinity and will be able to update your payment method.

## In conclusion

The management of your account on our platform is designed to simplify the performance of all the necessary updates for your account and the organization you manage, allowing the update of any data at any time and always implementing the appropriate security measures.
