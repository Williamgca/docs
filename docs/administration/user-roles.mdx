For a secure and efficient management of your product catalog and company data in our store, Infinity implements a role-based access system for all users you invite to your store on our platform. This way, each user will have meticulously assigned accesses, according to what you require them to do in your store.

## What is the roles purpose?

Thanks to this, you can manage in detail all the accesses that the invited users will have to collaborate in your store. Thus, you keep your data safe with structured access and allow users responsible for developing your data to access only what they should see and edit, according to your requirements.

You can learn more about how to create and edit these roles to assign them to your users in our article **'How to create roles?'**.

It's important that you first create the roles that will be assigned to your users, with all the accesses that each role allows on our platform, in order to assign them to the users you invite to your store or to those whom you need to update their accesses within it.

## In conclusion

The access management through roles offered by our platform ensures that all the users you invite to collaborate in your store have the accesses allowed by your company, based on what they can see, edit, create, or delete from your product catalog or your connections.
