Our platform features an intuitive and easy-to-understand subscription system. This allows you to take advantage of all the possibilities and functions that Infinity offers through a monthly or annual payment method, as you decide, by subscribing to our usage plan.

## Important aspects of subscriptions on our platform

To learn all about what our platform offers, we invite you to subscribe to our plan and visit our website. There, you will find detailed information on all the integrations, automations, and functionalities available to you, enabling you to effectively implement your company's products on our platform.

Starting is very easy: you just need to create your account on our platform. See our article **'How to create an account'** for more details.

When you create your account for the first time, a 14-day free trial will automatically be enabled, during which you will have access to all the functionalities of our platform. This will give you enough time to explore how to adapt your business before making any payment. We recommend reviewing the article **'Getting started'** to learn about the main actions available during this free trial.

During these 14 days of free trial, you can implement all the connections and data of your store without limitations. If you decide to continue with us and subscribe to Infinity, you can manage the same account, organization, and stores created during the free trial, keeping all your data intact.

If the 14 days of free trial end, and you have not yet associated a payment method, you will be redirected to a page indicating that your subscription has expired. There, a button will direct you to the payment portal. Once you add the payment method, you will regain access to your store with all the data intact.

If you have an account, but need it to collaborate on the data of a store belonging to an organization with an active subscription, you do not need your own subscription. You can find more information in our article **'Invite new users'**.

In the top right corner of our platform, you will find a drop-down menu with different options, such as editing your profile, changing stores, or logging out.

## How do you manage your account subscription in Infinity?

The process is very simple. Access your account options in the top right corner, where you will find options to edit your profile, change stores (more details in our article **'Managing multi-stores'**), and log out. To manage your subscription, select **'My profile'**.

You will be redirected to the profile editing portal, where you will find various tabs to update your account data, change your password, edit your organization's data, and finally, manage your subscription. See our article 'How to edit my user profile' for more information.

In the last tab, you will see a **'Billing & Plans'** button that will take you to the subscription management portal. Here, you can see the status of your subscription, your data, the expiration date and, if you wish, cancel it. The subscription automatically renews month by month, but you can switch to the annual plan at any time.

If it's your first time subscribing, and you are in the free trial period, you only need to enter your payment method in our subscription portal. We will send you reminder emails before the expiration date so you can associate your payment method.

With this information, you will be able to activate and manage your subscription to our platform efficiently.

## In conclusion

Managing the subscription of your account and organization to manage your product catalog on our platform is a streamlined process, which you can set up in a few simple steps without complications.
