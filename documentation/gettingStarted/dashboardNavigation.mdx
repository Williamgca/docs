Our platform features an optimized dashboard, so you can keep control of your products, see your current numbers, and have timely tracking of all your data currently managed on our platform. In the following article, we will break down all the sections, fields, and accesses you will find on our dashboard:

## Section 1: Live Statistics

In this section, you'll find a table that will provide you with various numbers offering valuable insights for timely monitoring of important points related to the products you manage on our platform. Such data includes:

- In stock: In this field, you will find the total number of products on our platform that currently have active stock for sale on your sales channels, whether they have data sources from distributors or any data source connected to your external inventory system.
- No stock: Related to the previous field, this counter will show you how many of your products on our platform currently do not have stock. Keep in mind that there may be products that, although they have a data source from one of your distributors, this same may not have stock for their products, so it will likewise be counted as not having stock for sale on your sales channels.
- No distributors: This counter will tell you how many of the products currently on our platform do not have any linked data source, meaning the product does not have any linked distributor nor is it in your inventory system, so it does not have any active data source.
- Completed: This counter will give you the total number of products on your platform that are in our **'Completed'** stage, which, if set up with your e-commerce, will be automatically published on your website.

## Section 2: Summary

In this section, you will find various key counters related to storage and total data that your store currently has within our platform.

Keep in mind that these counters are purely informational for your store, as our platform does not set any type of limit or extra cost for the storage or management of your store's data.

### Such counters are as follows:

- All products: This counter will let you know the total number of products you currently have created in your store.
- All channels: This counter contains the total number of sales channels you have connected and active with your store within our platform.
- All data sources: This counter will tell you the total number of distributors you currently have linked with your store.
- All brands: This counter will tell you the total number of brands you have created and stored in your store.
- All categories: This counter will reflect the total number of categories you have created in your store. This counts all the separate categories that have been created in your store.
- All users: This counter will let you know how many users you currently have invited to collaborate in your store.

## Section 3: Last activity

This section will show you a list of the last five actions carried out in your store in detail.

### This list includes relevant information such as:

- The type of action.
- The name of the user who performs the action with the action.
- The date and time of the action.

This way, you can see, in detail and currently, the most recent actions carried out on the data of your products on our platform, allowing you to take quick actions upon seeing the last hour in which some activity was carried out on your products.

## Section 4: Last products completed

In this section, you will have a report with the last six products that were sent from our **'Revision'** stage to **'Completed'**.

This table will have a preview of the main image of the products, the SKU, a preview of the title, and will also have an **'Edit'** button, which allows you to go to the selected product's editing card to validate its details.

## Section 5: Stages

In this section, you will find direct access to all the stages of our platform, both those that make up our workflow and the complementary ones.

Each of these stages will be separated into the same chart where you can see all the stages, which will have quick access with just a click, in addition to having a counter with the total number of products currently in each of them, allowing you to easily know how many of your products are missing what type of data depending on the stage they are in.

You can learn more about each of our product stages, how they work, and what data each requires in our article **'Product stages'**.

## Section 6: Todayâ€™s movements

In this section, you will have a table with all the actions per user that have been carried out on the day in each of the stages of our platform.

This table contains three columns, which make up each of the stages of our platform, both those that make up the workflow and the complementary ones, and next to each one of them is the user and the total number of products that have been worked on in each stage throughout the day.

With this, you will have a clear and agile idea of the daily productivity of your work system, monitoring the total products completed in each of our stages and being able to make decisions to optimize your workflow efficiently.
