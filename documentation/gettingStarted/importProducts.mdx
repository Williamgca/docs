Our platform offers an efficient solution for the creation and management of products in bulk, allowing you to import all your products with all the necessary information found on our product editing page. In this article, we will explain how you can use our import portal to manage all the products you handle in your store quickly and easily.

## Step by step to import your products

Before explaining how to import your products, we suggest reviewing our article **'Imports and exports'**. There, you will find all the necessary information to understand our import and export portal and the various types we offer to manage your products.

To import your products, you must first go to the **'Imports'** section, located under the **'Administration'** section in the left menu of our platform.

1. Once in this section, you should select the **'Schedule an import'** button. Doing so will open the import window.
2. In the window, you must select **'Products'** from the drop-down menu of the **'Type'** section.
3. After selecting it, in the **'Action'** section, select the **'Create'** option.
4. Then the button right next to it, named **'Get template'**, will be enabled, and you can download the product import template.

With this, you will have the product import template of our platform to start registering your data in it. Each import template comes with a documentation sheet, where you will find all the information related to the template, including what to place in each field, as well as which ones are mandatory.

Once you have correctly registered your data in this template, as indicated in the documentation, you will simply have to save your changes and upload the same file in the same window from which you downloaded the template. Right below the dropdown from which you selected the type of action, you will have the field to select and upload the file with the button **'Choose File'**.

With the file uploaded to the window, you only have to select the **'Submit'** button. With this, the import file with your products will be processed by our import portal and queued for the creation of your products on our platform. In this same section, you can monitor the progress of this file's upload, when it has finished, and whether it has errors.
