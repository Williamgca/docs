Creating an account on our platform is a simple process designed to facilitate your start, whether it's to establish your own organization and stores or to join the stores of the organization where you work. Below, we detail the steps to create your account clearly and simply.

## Step 1: Complete the registration form

First, enter the following link that will take you to the account creation portal at Infinity. There, you will find the essential fields for registration, which include:

1. Your first and last name, which will identify you on our platform.
2. The email address you will link to your account, where you will receive the activation email and updates related to your user or invitations to other stores.
3. The password and its confirmation, necessary to access your account or re-enter if your session closes.

After completing these details and clicking on the save button, you will be redirected to a confirmation page that will inform you about the sending of an email to activate your account.

## Step 2: Receive the email and activate your account

After correctly completing the form, you will receive an email to activate your account. This email contains a button that will direct you to our platform and complete the activation of your account.

At this point, you will already have your account at Infinity correctly created and enabled for use or to be invited to access other stores.

## Step 3: Last steps

With your account now created, consider the following to make the most of Infinity and connect with the stores of your interest:

- **14 days of free trial:** All new users enjoy 14 days of free trial, allowing you to explore all the functionalities of Infinity without restrictions.
- **Subscription to Infinity:** During or at the end of your trial, you can activate your subscription from the user menu, selecting **'Billing & Plans'**. You will be taken to a secure payment portal to associate your payment method and ensure the continuity of the service after the trial period.
- **What happens after the 14 days of free trial?:** If the 14 days of free trial for your account are completed, and you have not yet associated a payment method, you will be redirected to a dedicated page mentioning that your subscription has expired. There, you will find a button that will redirect you to the subscription payment portal. Once you add a payment method, then you will be redirected to our platform and will again have all the access to your store and all the data intact, just as you had in your store before the free trial expired.
- **Do you need to pay for the subscription even if you only need the account to be invited to a store for which you work?:** If you have an account, but do not need it for your own business, it is not required to have an active subscription. Simply having your account created will allow you to be invited to enter a store belonging to an organization that already has an active subscription to our platform. You can learn more about this in our article **'Invite new users'**.

In relation to the previous case, keep in mind that you do not need to first create an account at Infinity to be invited to an organization. The company for which you work, if it already has an active Infinity subscription, simply needs to send an invitation to the user's email required.

In case this email does not have an account on our platform, upon receiving the store invitation email, this invitation allows them to create their account with their previously mentioned details and automatically access the store to which they were invited, without the need to have created the account prior to being invited to a store.

On the other hand, if the user to be invited already had an account created in Infinity, it is as simple as receiving the invitation and accepting it, so that automatically you would belong to the organization that invited you.

## In conclusion

The creation of your account at Infinity is intuitive and designed to guide you at every step, ensuring that you can start without inconveniences and maximize your experience during the 14-day free trial.
