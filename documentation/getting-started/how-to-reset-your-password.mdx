Resetting your password on our platform is a simple and secure process. In this article, we guide you step by step so you can regain access to your account or simply change your current password.

## Considerations

To reset or change your password, we can do it in two different scenarios: one in which you want to update your password while your session is active on our platform, and the second, in case you try to log in but can't remember your password, so you need to change it.

Infinity implements security standards when creating or updating a password. If your new password does not meet these standards, you will receive an alert mentioning that your password is not valid. The standards are as follows: the password must be at least 8 characters, include an uppercase, a lowercase, a digit, and a special character (for example, #?!@$%^&*-).

## How to change the password while keeping the session active:

With your session started on our platform, to update your password, you only need to go to the top right corner, in the options of your profile, and select the first option **'My profile'**. In this data update portal, you will find fields to update the main details of your account, such as your email, the first and last name with which you are identified on our platform. In the **'Security'** section, you will find the field that allows you to update the password for your account.

Once you enter the new password, a new modal will open informing you that you will receive a confirmation code in the email associated with your account to make the password change. After receiving the email and entering the received code in the modal, your password will be correctly updated, and you will receive a confirmation alert from our platform.

## How to reset your password when logging in:

If you need to log in and can't remember your password, the process to reset it is quite simple. You just need to click on the **'Forgot password?'** button, located next to the field where you enter your password.

After clicking on this button, you will be redirected to the password reset portal. Here, you only need to enter the email of your account and select the **'Submit'** button. With this, you will receive an email with instructions for resetting your password, including a button that will redirect you to the update portal for the same.

At the end of the process, you should enter the new password you wish to use and confirm it in the corresponding field to avoid errors. Once completed, select the **'Save'** button and your password will have been successfully updated. You will be redirected to the login portal of our platform; enter your email and new password to access your account in Infinity again.

## In conclusion

Updating or resetting your password is vital to keeping access to your account secure. By following these steps, you can do it quickly and securely, ensuring that your account and your data are protected.
