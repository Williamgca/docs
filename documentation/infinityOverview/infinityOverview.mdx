This article details the key functionalities and tools for implementing Infinity in your company.

## Customized dashboard and user experience

In our platform's dashboard, you'll find the control center for managing all your products. This dashboard offers multiple options and shortcuts for efficient data management.

Here, you have shortcuts to all the product stages you have on our platform, including those that make up the workflow by stages (like new products, review, etc.). You can learn more about our product stages in the article **'Product stages'** in our documentation.

Besides, you'll have shortcuts to all the product stages you manage on our platform. Additionally, at the top of the dashboard, you'll find counters and detailed summaries about the current status of your products, offering valuable information such as the total number of products in your store and their distribution by stages.

For more details on these summaries, we invite you to review our article **'Dashboard navigation'**.

## Workflow by stages

Our platform implements an organized system by stages for detailed control of your products, allowing you to effectively manage the information of each product based on its stage on our platform. All this is complemented by our automated task that will relocate your products in each of these stages based on the data they contain. It's like working with your products on a production line.

For example, you can quickly identify products without titles, brands, or categories assigned, as they will automatically be in the **'New products'** stage. Similarly, products without descriptions or images will be placed in the **'Essential data'** stage.

Explore more about our workflow by stages and the automatic relocation of products in the articles **'Product stages'** and **'Relocating products between stages'**, respectively.

## Advanced tools for editing and managing products

Our platform implements multiple solutions and tools for optimal management of your products' data. This includes everything from main data like titles, descriptions, and images, to advanced data for enriching your website, such as attributes, documentation, or SEO.

These functionalities are easy to implement from the product editing sheet on our platform, designed to be intuitive and easy to use. Plus, you can easily import or update product data through our import portal.

You can learn more about our product editing sheet in the article **'Product editing page'**, as well as the possibilities of imports offered by our platform in **'Imports and exports'**.

## Integration and synchronization with multiple channels

Infinity allows you to connect your store with all your sales channels, without restrictions or additional costs. You can integrate as many products as you want into all your sales channels.

All this, without any limitation or extra price, means your store can connect with as many sales channels as required for its business model, just as you can connect as many products as required in all your sales channels without limitations on postings or storage.

Similarly, if your store requires a sales channel that is currently not integrated on our platform for connection, you can request the addition of this. Our team will analyze the sales channel and see its integration possibilities. Once it is ready and can be used for your store, you will see it in the sales channel configuration to be set up.

You can learn much more about our connections with sales channels, how they work, and how to configure their connections in our article **'Integrations with sales channels'**.

## Analysis and reports for better decision-making

Our platform implements a reporting system that allows you to follow all movements and updates of your products daily, accounting for the product-by-product updates of stage changes made daily.

This reporting portal has a filtering system by date ranges as required, in addition to having a button to export all reports according to the filters you have applied.

You can learn more about our reporting system in our article **'How do reports work?'**

## Customization and flexibility

Our platform offers endless possibilities when integrating any tool, distributor, or sales channel for your store. Whenever you need a new integration for your organization's operation on our platform, you are free to request its addition, and our team will study it and implement it on the platform so you can use it without any extra charge to your subscription.

Not only at the level of integrations, if you require any functionality or specific field for your products within our platform, you are completely free to request in detail the requirement you have, and our team will analyze its implementation and functionality within the platform, just like the integrations, without any cost or extra charge on your subscription.
