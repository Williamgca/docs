This article details how you can invite a user to access the stores that make up your organization, whether this user already has an account created on our platform or not, by editing their access according to the roles and the store to which they belong.

## Steps to invite a user to your organization

To add a new user to your organization and assign them to a specific store, follow these steps:

1. Access the **'Users'** section, which you will find in the left menu of our platform, and click on the **'Invite user'** button. Upon doing so, a modal will appear with the necessary fields to send the invitation.
2. In the **'Email'** field, enter the email of the user you wish to invite. This user will receive an email with a direct link to join your store after logging into their account.
3. Select the store the user will have access to from the **'Stores'** field. This field will display all the stores available in your organization. If you only own one store, this step will automatically be skipped, assigning access to the only store in your organization.
4. Finally, in the **'User Roles'** field, all the roles previously established in the selected store will be displayed, allowing you to assign the appropriate role to the user and the access they will have once they accept the invitation. Learn more about our **'User Roles'** in our article **'How do roles work?'**.

Once the invited user accesses the email and clicks on the invitation link, they will automatically gain access to the store and the role assigned during the invitation process. If the user does not yet have an account with us, they will be able to set a password, and an account will automatically be created for them with the same invitation link.

## In conclusion

Adding and modifying your users' access to your stores on our platform is an intuitive and essential process for efficient team management and secure access control in your organization. This functionality offers flexibility in the assignment of user roles and stores, ensuring that each team member has the necessary access to perform their tasks effectively.
