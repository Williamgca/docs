Our platform implements an optimized system for organizations that allows you to manage multiple stores from a single interface. This system adapts to any business model or company using a multi-store methodology for selling products, enabling different departments to stay organized on a single platform for efficient management. Best of all, this is offered without any extra charges or limitations on the subscription.

## Start defining your stores by organization.

First, it's necessary to have an account on our platform, either under an active subscription or by taking advantage of the 14-day free trial period. It's important to highlight that the trial has no limitations. If you want to know how to create your account, we invite you to read our article **'How to create an account'**.

When you create your account, our platform will automatically generate an organization and a default store with random names. You can see these assigned names in the top left corner of our platform, where you will also find the remaining time of your trial period (if applicable), the name of your organization, the name of your store, and your username next to it.

Once inside your account and familiarized with how to identify your organization and store, the first step is to define the name of your organization. To do this, go to your account settings, which you'll find at the top right of our platform, by selecting your user and clicking on **'My profile'**.

In this section, you'll find some fields related to your user data within our platform, broken down into segments. In the **'Organization'** segment, you can change the name of your company, which will group the stores you manage on our platform.

After defining your organization by updating the name of your company, you can proceed to the next step: modifying and creating your stores. For more details on managing, editing, and creating new stores in your organization, consult our article **'Create a new store'**. Additionally, our article **'Invite new users'** will provide you with all the necessary information to add new users to your stores.

By completing these steps, you will have set up the complete ecosystem of your company on our platform, including your organization and all the stores you manage. The next step is to start importing your products to each store. To discover all the benefits and tools our platform offers, we recommend reading the article **'How to start on Infinity?'**.
