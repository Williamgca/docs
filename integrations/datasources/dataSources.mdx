Our integrations with data sources allow you to enjoy a constant, real-time, and automated connection and update of your products with the costs and inventories offered by your distributors. Thanks to these integrations, you will have the costs and inventories of your products updated in real-time automatically whenever there are changes in your distributors.

## What are the products' data sources

Primarily, you should know that to access the settings of the distributors available to be data sources for your currently active products on our platform, you must go to the menu on the left side of our platform. There, you will find the option 'Edit data sources' under the 'Administration' section. In this, you will find the list with all the distributors currently active on our platform.

To configure and activate each of these distributors, our platform will take care of reflecting in its settings the exact fields you need to complete to establish the connection between your store and your data on our platform.

Keep in mind that each integration requires different credentials for its connection, based on the data handled by each distributor. It is worth noting that you can easily obtain such data on each platform, for which you can review their respective documentation to facilitate your connection processes.

## Consider the following fundamental aspects for a timely setup of your distributors

The connections between your products and those of your distributors work through two alternatives: either by the product's barcode if it has one, or, if not, it will be validated by its brand and part number to be linked with those of your distributor. For this, we suggest reviewing our article 'What's raw products?' to know all the settings you must make for this integration to work correctly.

Similarly, our article 'What are data sources?' explains everything that these integrations involve for your products on our platform. Just like our article 'How to setup a data source?' will teach you how to correctly configure these data sources in your store.

## In conclusion

The integration with data sources is a vital component in efficient management to have costs and inventories automatically updated. On our platform, these integrations are designed to ensure that your products are always up-to-date with their sales data and without any errors, while mitigating any process of validation, extraction, and manual updating of these data.
